[👉 Visit Cat TV](https://cat-tv.net)

## About Cat TV

Cat TV on our site is different: you **create it**. Use our canvas tool to design **cat tv for cats** and interactive **tv for cats** scenes your pet can enjoy.

You can compose motion with sprites, add **video birds for cats**–style tracks, and export a finished **video for cats**. Turn your ideas into unique **cat videos for cats** and longer **cat videos for cats to watch** at home.

It’s not **YouTube cat tv**; it’s your own studio—perfect for owners who want tailored **cat games for cats**-like experiences and a calm **cat on tv** session without distractions.

## Features

* 🎨 **Canvas tool** – design your own cat TV scenes
* 🐦 **Add motion & sprites** – birds, toys, or anything fun for your cat
* 🐾 **Interactive fun** – more than just watching, it’s playful engagement

## Why Cat TV?

* Make **personalized cat videos** your cat actually enjoys
* Reduce stress for indoor cats with playful visual stimulation
* Share your custom creations with other pet lovers
